# <RFC title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the deprecation.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What are the problems with the deprecated feature?
What is the replacement functionality?

## Transition Path

> This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the use-cases that deprecated functionality
covers, and for each use-case, describe the transition path.
Describe it in enough detail for someone who uses the deprecated functionality
to understand, for someone to write the deprecation guide, and for someone
familiar with the implementation to implement.

## How We Teach This

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean major portions of the Pachyderm
docs must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how Pachyderm is taught
to new users?

Does it mean we need to put effort into highlighting the replacement
functionality more? What should we do about documentation related to this feature?

How should this deprecation be introduced and explained to existing Pachyderm
users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Pachyderm,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing pipelines, etc.
There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
